            <h2>WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?</h2>
            <p>Elecricity is the FLOW OF ELECTRONS.  Electrons are part of ATOMS, tiny particles that make up everything that exists. In atoms, protons and electrons have a CHARGE. (protons = positive, electrons = negative.) Protons combine with NEUTRONS to create the NUCLEUS of an atom.  ELECTRONS flow around the nucleus; hence, electricity is created by the flow of electrons.

            <h2>EXAMPLES OF ELECTRICITY</h2>
            <p>Electricity is in every aspect of our lives, yet we can't always see it.  Here are some examples of electricity that we can see:</p>

            <h2>TYPES OF CURRENTS
</h2>
            <p>There are two types of currents that electricity uses: direct currents and alternating currents. DIRECT CURRENTS are also direct sources of power.  This includes batteries in your cell phone, your iPod, or your 3DS. ALTERNATING CURRENTS are less direct.  They can be found anywhere in your home where there is an outlet.  You can plug in chargers, lamps, and refridgerators into these outlets to get power 24/7.</p>

            <h2>VOCABULARY YOU SHOULD KNOW</h2>
            <h3>Be sure to know these words. They'll be on the quiz!</h3>
            <ul class="vocab">
                <li>CONDUCTORS: materials that let electricity flow well. Some examples include metals like copper and aluminum.
</li>
                <li>INSULATORS: materials that protect us from electricity.  Some examples include rubber, paper, and plastic.</li>
                <li>VOLTAGE: a measurement of the electric force that causes electrons to flow.
</li>
                <li>CURRENT: a measurement of the flow of electrons in a circuit. Measured in AMPS.
</li>
                <li>POWER: a measurement of the power/energy used by a circuit.  Measured in WATTS. the formula is: POWER = CURRENT X VOLTAGE.</li>
                <li>RESISTANCE: how well a material/object conducts electricity.  Low resistance makes a good conductor, while high resistance makes a bad conductor.</li>
            </ul>
